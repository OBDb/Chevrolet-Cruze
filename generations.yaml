    description: "The original Chevrolet Cruze was a globally developed compact car built on GM's Delta II platform, internally designated J300. Initially launched in South Korea and gradually rolled out worldwide, it represented GM's first truly global compact car program. In most markets, it was available as a four-door sedan, with a five-door hatchback added later. Engine options varied by region but typically included 1.4L to 2.0L gasoline engines and various diesel options, with the turbocharged 1.4L being the most common in North America. The interior featured a dual-cockpit design with better materials than previous GM compact cars, while safety was emphasized with up to ten airbags in some markets."
